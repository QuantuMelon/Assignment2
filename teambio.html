<p>Hi, I'm Ash. Upon completion of Year 12 in Toowomba excelling in building / hands-on classes with success in Fitter training &ndash;The Airforce welcomed me into Squadron 1 for six years which is a part of the 82nd Wing located in Amberley Queensland. My primary assignment; F111-C Aircraft maintenance while participating in deployment exercises around Australia. My venture with the Airforce left me yearning for normality. Once returning home I flourished in my apprenticeship diesel fitting for the Toowoomba Regional council. Daily black oil showers left me quite unenthused. My mechanical hands then saw use in Hervey Bay, building their retirement home overlooking the sea and Fraser Island. Then, working as a road traffic controller dealing with the public and road construction crews, which I enjoyed for 6 years in the heat until COVID reared its head. This gave me the perfect opportunity to enrol in an IT degree with RMIT. I have always been an avid gamer, mainly gaming on PC but occasionally on consoles as well. The 4 year old female cat called Misty in my residence loves to sit on my PC and supervise everything I do. <br /><br /><br />Hi I&rsquo;m Brad! Student ID S3866661 Sports wise - I&rsquo;m into cycling, gym, and tennis. There is nothing wrong with a date night indoors on a Friday night enjoying some pizza and ice cream watching some Sci-fi on TV creating that much needed inner world to explore while enjoying time with loved ones. Education-wise - I studied a Certificate III in Web applications &amp; Information technology after not finishing secondary school. I chose adventure and life over school. During this time - I breezed through this learning new things - such as Flash, Dreamweaver, Office applications. I achieved high distinctions making a few silly mistakes lowering some scores, and I enjoyed studying. A few interesting things about me ; I am known to adopt some fairly quirky ideas when solving problems. At work, sometimes we get crates of IT Equipment that needed to get delivered around the site. My Plan to save a chunk of time was to get a crane stuck into the containers and lift them from the basement to the turbine floor. Everyone thought I was insane for coming up with this idea, but they all agreed that if you wanted it done quickly, this would be the way to do it. I&rsquo;m usually the one to come up with quirky or untraditional ways to complete tasks and I thrive from this. I am somewhat like a crazy Macgyver when it comes to ideas<br /><br />Name: Declan T. Age: 22 Email: S3868255@student.rmit.edu.au I am passionate about Information Technology, currently completing my bachelor's degree at RMIT. I was born in Australia and raised with an Italian background. I love NRL &amp; Melbourne Storm, so much I'm accredited from the NRL to go onto the field before &amp; after the game! Once I left school, I pursued a bachelor's degree in science, hoping to major in chemistry, which I didn't commence. Eventually, my interest in IT brought me to I am building my computer (learning on the fly), enjoying various elements of Virtualization after doing so. <br /><br /><br />Name: Jayde Speedie Preferred name: Speedie RMIT Student Number: S3525668 Email: speedie.devs@gmail.com About me: I am a caucasian female from Melbourne Victoria, and I am at least 4th generation Australian. I completed Year 12 (VCE) in 2015 and then went onto study an Advanced Diploma of Professional Games Development (Design Stream) graduating in 2017. I have subsequently been working for the last two and a half years while I find where I want to take my life and career. My primary language is English and is the only one I can fluently speak, and I also know a little French and Japanese. I am also currently learning Mandarin. I am an Indie game developer working in a small team to create a mobile puzzle game. My passion for IT has originated from playing video games. It first started from modding games such as Minecraft, building my systems and then moving to make my games on Game Maker. It wasn't until I was finishing year 12 that I realised that information technology was something that I wanted to pursue a little more, it wasn't until the start of this year that I decided that I wanted to pursue it as a career. <br /><br />Hi, I&rsquo;m Miller &ndash; My tastes in music passtionately varied between heavy metal, rap and everything else. I actively participated in Football (AFL) growing up &ndash; but now I prefer to watch it live or at the stadium. I have a culturally diverse background, with mixtures of British, Scottish, Italian, German and Malaysian. My adorable cat Poe is named after &ldquo;The Thinker&rdquo; statue, rather than initially desiring &ldquo;The Poet&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s daily calling. Poe would strategize waiting for the most convenient time to strike when his siblings would be play fighting, and this is how the name Poe &ldquo;the thinker&rdquo; arose.</p>
