            <h1>Wide Awake</h1>
          <h5>overview</h5>
            <p>The project I have chosen is a virtual reality (VR) survival shooter, which will include a custom controller for the player to plug their VR controller into in order to play with, this will be an optional addition, players are able to play both with and without the controller. The controller would be 3D printed with a small motherboard inside that would allow connection to not only the controller but the computer as well in order to function, the reason for this will be detailed below. The game would be based on a small child's nightmare in a doll house, with life size dolls coming in waves to get the main character. The custom controller itself would be in the shape of a toy dart gun that would also be visualised in the game.</p>

        <h5>Motivation</h5>
        <p>The main motivation behind this project idea is the lack of survival shooters for those with VR. Most VR shooter games are either competitive; against other people in nature or campaign driven, whereas this game will be more of an endless style survival shooter aimed at a younger audience. Another motivation is the lack of VR games with their own custom controller. You have companies such as Zero Latency that allow you to come in and use their controller but it isn't something you can play from your own home. The controller itself would be light enough for easy access to a younger audience as well.</p>

        <h5>Description</h5>
        <p>You awake one night to find that you are no longer in your bed, but in the doll house that has sat untouched for months in your living room. In your hands you find your favourite dart gun and in the other a flashlight, in the distance a giggle, frozen in place with fear you must survive as long as possible.</p>

        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>This game places you in the position of a child stuck in a repetitive nightmare, with waves of dolls coming to get you. The game itself plays as an endless shooter, scoring you points and game currency as you fight your way through the endless stream of enemies.
         <h5> Player:</h5> Stuck in the one place/small area to move around in, able to turn 360 degrees. Flash light in one hand and dart gun in the other. Health bar that takes damage from the dolls when they get too close.
<h5>Flashlight:</h5> Helps slightly increase visibility in what is a pretty dark environment. But will have to balance keeping it charged as if it is used for too long power will run out. Upgrades available from the shop
<h5>Dart Gun:</h5> Endless ammo but starting dart gun will have a sluggish fire rate with upgrades available.
<h5>Dolls:</h5> 3 different enemies each with their own unique ‘traits’. Betty moves at a regular speed but will take average damage before defeated. Sally is faster but takes less damage to be defeated. Dawn is more of a boss, bigger and will charge towards the player if they are not looking, but will slow down when the player is looking at them. A large amount of damage will need to be inflicted before being defeated, has a distinctive laugh to let the player know when she has come to play. Each doll will award the player points for unlocks and currency to buy new items.
<h5>Shop:</h5> Option in the main menu can buy upgrades for guns and flashlights; these function as a one off purchase so players are able to switch between different weapons.. Other objects you can buy include health potions and traps for enemies; these function as a buy a number of items to use.

        <h3>The Custom Controller</h3>
        <p>A 3D printed dart gun will be designed for use as a controller which will be partnered along with the game's release. People can also opt to just buy the game without the controller or purchase the controller later. It will contain a holder for the VR controller, different versions would then need to be made for the different available controllers. Will contain a trigger button that when pressed sends a signal to a small circuit board in the controller to fire off the gun in game. 
The reason for the VR controller to be plugged in and connected to the additional controller is to use the battery pack inside the gun to run the VR controller. This is because if you keep them separate the controller can die and it can be a pain to try and swap batteries and or charge the separate gun. The reason for the internal circuit board is to determine not only if there is a controller connected to use as opposed to the general VR controller, but also so that the player can press the trigger on the controller to fire the gun. The VR controller itself would then just be used to track the location of the gun.
The Controller would come with the option of connecting via Bluetooth to the player's computer if the computer had available software or an extra dongle would be included for connection.
