		    Overall I believe that the Audit Trail does reflect work quite well for the web-site aspect however it doesn’t accurately reflect the extra-curricular work required for the presentation aspect. Specifically - proofreading / Grammarly. It is all too easy to commit to the same file 100 times on GitHub and claim “You did the most work” when that isn’t necessarily the case. Nobody is doing that in our group, because in fact - the entire team really put in their share of work as highlighted above breaking these aspects down as seen above.

During this assignment, it was deemed that Discord would be utilised for team communications holding our meetings/briefings. Twitch was temporarily used a couple of times in order to present when there were issues using Discord - however Discord is free, team-oriented and easy to share files across with. It has built-in voice channels and chats as per the screenshot. We were able to leverage the use of headsets, text and have some fun with meme’s to facilitate productivity on the fly.  
 <br>
Trello - this was the work distribution system to assign work across the team once it had been discussed and With Trello is works based on “Cards” where a task can be created with checkboxes (To-do lists) - and assign to specific people. It also allows for comments to be done to alert people mainly in the notifications section on the right-hand side. It keeps everyone updated with changes as well. Screenshot below 
<br>
 
Github - was an easy way to upload HTML Code to get CSS and a web site going in a very short space of time with the goal of presenting out data on a live site highlighting an IT project. The main benefit of this tool is multiple contributors were able to upload changes to code/data and effectively make use of sharing contributions around where the project required this. Much better than using other methods of tooling (sharing files around with email for example) as changes happen on the fly, and the web site updates immediately with a copy available for use within minutes (once DNS / servers update etc)
